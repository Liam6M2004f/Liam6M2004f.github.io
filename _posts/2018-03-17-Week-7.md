    <td>Today I was working with Deven again. It took us a while to figure out how to do the flashing lights but we did get it in the end, the usual strategy was effective and I learnt about the wires and what's needed to do flashing lights.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mr.Ampah-Korsah wasn't here today so we got to work straight away. We worked all lesson but some people distracted everyone by messing about. I think this limited my learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I hope that we will be better at robot arms than we were at flashing lights. I will improve my learning by being quicker at seeing the fuze box up and being more efficient with wires and other similar things.
