    <td>Today I learned quite a lot as I got through many sections and worked very hard to do it. My strategies was to ignore all distractions and just get on with my work this was very effective as it allowed me to work very efficiently.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that absolutely nothing limited my learning today, I had no bad habits and worked hard the whole lesson. No body distracted me so I got really far in this lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to do the same as this lesson because if I continue at this pace I will finish codecademy python in no time. I could push myself to work even harder next lesson and I would be done quicker.</td>
