    <td>This was our first lesson so we had to be taught the basics of Python to start off with, once we knew the basics we went on to a  website called CodeCademy and made accounts. This website has a guide to using Python and we will be using it in our IT lessons for the rest of year 8.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>At the start of the lesson we had to be taught the basics so this meant sitting around for fifteen minutes not getting on with CodeCademy. This meant we started later than we could of, we did however need this talk as we didn't know anything about Python.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I  think we will start straight away meaning that we can do as much work as possible in class. As i got onto section two of Python for homework I reckon in the next lesson I could get to section three or maybe even further. I will improve my learning by not rushing and reading the question thoroughly.</td>
