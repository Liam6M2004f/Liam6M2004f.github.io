Today we didn't have an IT lesson as it was a bank holiday this is the reason why my blog will be so quick today. If we did have a lesson we would of been working on python, Mr.Keen may of taught us some new stuff but we don't know. Next Monday we will definitely have a lesson though. I think he will be expecting us to do some more work on Codecademy for homework, so that is what I am going to do just to be safe.
