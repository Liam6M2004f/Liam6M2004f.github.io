  <tr>
    <td>Today I learned quite a lot as I got through many sections and worked very hard to do it. I learnt to always read the entire passage before starting to code and do what the instructions tell me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would go as far as saying nothing limited my learning, everyone was very quiet around me and that let me focus very well. I didn't have any bad habits today and overall I was very good in this lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to do the same as this lesson because if I continue at this pace I will finish codecademy python in no time. I could push myself to work even harder next lesson and I would be done quicker.</td>
