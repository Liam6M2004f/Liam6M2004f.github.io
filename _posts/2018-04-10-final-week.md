    <td>This was our final lesson so we wanted to work extra hard and get as much work as possible done. The strategy where one person types and one reads the text out was successful today like it is every week. We used it efficiently today and it sped us up a bit.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>At the start of the lesson me and Deven weren't very quick to set the Fuze Box up and we also weren’t quick to load up last weeks work, but as soon as we were ready we worked really hard and did a lot of work in the lesson.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>next time I don’t think we will be doing Fuze, I think we will be doing a thing called Python. If we did have another Fuze lesson I would try to set everything up quicker so that we can get to work straight away.</td>
