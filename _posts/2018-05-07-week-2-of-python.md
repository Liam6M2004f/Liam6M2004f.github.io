  <tr>
    <td>The whole lesson was working on codecademy I made it quite far today. The strategy I used was to read the entire question and not give up if I couldn't do something, this helped particularly as i got stuck a few times.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mr Keen didnâ€™t check our blogs so we could just get straight to work this always help us to do as much work as possible, if he does check our blogs then it takes ten minutes which is ten minutes of work we could of done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>next time I hope I can work faster so I can more work done, this means that I can get onto Mr.Keens fun challenges. I think there are 12 sections to do for python so I am getting closer and closer.</td>
