    <td>Today we did loads of work on CodeCademy and started right away, we just came back from half term and during the half term I did quite a lot of work on python. So when we got back I wasn't completely lost. I made good progress today.</td>

    <td>Mr Keen didn’t check our blogs again so that’s how we got straight to work. Today my typing was very good and I didn’t make many errors, the problem was that I didn’t always read the entire text before the question so I would do some things wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to read the entire passage before every question, this will ensure that I don’t make silly mistakes. I could also maybe work quicker but I think part of that is because I didn’t read the entire question each time.</td>
