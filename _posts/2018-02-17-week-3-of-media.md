    <td>I was back working with Deven today. We started from where we left off. The equations started getting longer and more complex. So naturally we started making more mistakes and then we would have to go back and fix them. The same strategy as always was used- one typer and one reader. I think this strategies is very effective and we will continue to use it in the future.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today we worked quite efficiently and weren't to slow. We did however make a few to many mistakes in the lines of code like putting no capital letters or too many spaces in between words. We might work quicker if we can type faster and with less mistakes. We are quite far into the fuze manual now.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I hope we can type faster and faster so that we can write entire lines programs in minutes. I will improve my learning by going on the computer more often and type instead of using my iPad. I hope next week we can do lots more work on fuze.
