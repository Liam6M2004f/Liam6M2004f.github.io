    <td>Today I really tried to speed it all up, I was typing quicker and understanding the exercises better. I could work even faster if I didn't talk to the person next to me as much or get distracted by other students in the classroom.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning today apart from other people around me trying to talk to me, I was overall very productive but next time could try not to get distracted by other students.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to fully concentrate on my work and not be distracted by the other students, if I can do this I will finish python in no time. Then I will get onto Mr.Keenâ€™s challenging extension tasks.</td>
