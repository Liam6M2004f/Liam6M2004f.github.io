    <td>Today I was working with Peter as both of our partners were ill. Peter hadn't gotten as far as me and so I was doing more or less the same stuff i had done before. But we did do some interesting things like change the number of things and the names. Taking it it turns to say what to type and what to write was a very effective strategy, as it let us both customize the sentences.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was working with Peter who wasn’t as far on in Fuze as me so I was repeating stuff I had already done. I could of got further if my partner was here or if I worked alone, however I still learnt more even though I’d already done it all. I keep on making spelling mistakes, so that is a habit I could work on.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I hope my partner is here, I can do more work and further my knowledge of Fuze. I will improve my learning by not making as many mistakes and making more challenging and creative things for Fuze to say. I hope to make good progress in the next lesson. I will not be there for next lesson as I am in Germany.</td>
