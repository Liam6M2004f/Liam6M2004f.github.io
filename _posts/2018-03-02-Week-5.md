    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have made sufficient progress in fuze</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> partly, I was working with Emad and we don't work together as well as me and deven.</td>

    <td>Lesson Review</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As always the strategy where someone reads the manual out and someone types worked really well. It was a bit different with Emad however as we weren't used to working with each other. But regardless we did a good chunk of work in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that I was working with Emad and not deven limited my learning a bit. Me and deven call certain characters different names, and when I said one to Emad he has no clue what I meant. Also I'm still not used to the fuze keyboard and still make a few little mistakes, but they are getting less frequent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I want to work with deven again as there will be less confusion and we can work faster and still get more work done. I will try not to make as many spelling or grammar errors next week. This will result in us getting further.</td>
