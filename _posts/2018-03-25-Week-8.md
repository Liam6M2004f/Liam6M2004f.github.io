    <td>me and deven did some work on flashing lights last week and this week we did the assessment for it. We used the usual strategy and as usual it was very successful. It meant we both got a go at typing and reading.</td>

    <td>Mr Ampah-Korsah didn't check our blogs today so that sped us up.  Using all the wires slowed us down because it's hard to see which hole to put it in and if you don't get it right it won't work. My typing still isn't perfect.</td>

    <td>next time I hope we can work with the wire component kit thing. It will improve improve my learning because it was what slowed us down this week, I will also aim to improve the efficiency of my typing.</td>
