    <td>Today I was working with Deven, and we got pretty far with fuze. We learned how to change text and background colour, and how to make it solve simple equations. An effective strategy was for us to swap jobs every once in a while so we both got to try out being the navigator and the director. This helped us to achieve what we managed today, and at the end we saved our work onto both of our USB's, so we could start next week where we finished this week.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We weren't very quick starting but sped up during the lesson. A thing that limited my learning was how everything has to be proscise, all the spaces and capital letters had to be correct for to work, this slowed us down a bit. Next week we need to make sure we have all the capital letters and spaces so we can move on faster.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I hope we can set up the Fuze box a bit quicker, this might allow us to do more work. Now that we now what buttons save and which buttons edit we will be able to work faster in Fuze and do more interesting things. I think we made good progress this week.</td>
